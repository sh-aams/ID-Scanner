# ID Scanner for Information Extraction 🆔📷  

An **ESP32-S3-based ID scanner** that captures and extracts information from identification documents using an **OV5640 camera module**. This project automates text extraction using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for applications like identity verification and record-keeping.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Captures high-resolution ID images 📸  
✅ Extracts key details (Name, ID Number, DOB, etc.) 📝  
✅ Uses **ESP32-S3** for efficient processing ⚡  
✅ Supports **OCR (Tesseract/OpenCV)** for text recognition 🔍  
✅ Can be integrated with databases for authentication 🔐  

## 🛠 Hardware  
- **ESP32-S3 (with PSRAM)**  
- **OV5640 Autofocus Camera Module**
- **Adafruit BreakoutBoard for OV5640**
- Power & Communication Interfaces (I2C, DVP, UART, etc.)  

## 💻 Software  
- **ESP-IDF / Arduino** for ESP32 firmware  
- **OCR Engine (Tesseract/OpenCV)** for text extraction  
- **Python**

## 🔧 How It Works  
1. The **OV5640 camera** captures an image of an ID.  
2. The image is processed to enhance text visibility.  
3. **OCR extracts key details** (Name, ID Number, DOB, etc.).  
4. The extracted data can be displayed or stored for verification.  

## 🔥 Applications  
✅ Digital Identity Verification  
✅ Automated Check-in Systems  
✅ Smart Registration & KYC
